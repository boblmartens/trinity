PROJECT TRINITY

Project Trinity is my attempt at a web-based worship coordination app for my local congregation, and if it all works out, the rest of the world. It will focus around simple communication and proliferation of information between pastor and parishers in order to make the worship coordination experience easier and more fulfilling for everyone involved.
